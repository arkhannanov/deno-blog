# Testing Fresh Components, Middleware and Handlers with fresh-testing-library

The [`fresh-testing-library`](https://deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library) is a new unit testing utility for Deno Fresh. Until now testing a Fresh application used the built-in Deno test runner with `std/testing` utilities for verifying low-level logic and the [Deno-Puppeteer](https://deno.land/x/puppeteer) or [Astral](https://astral.deno.dev/) libs for end-to-end testing. The `fresh-testing-library` fills the niche between the other options to allow isolated testing of fresh components, middleware and route handlers.

`fresh-testing-library` is a thin wrapper around the [Preact Testing Library](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/preact-testing-library/) which is inspired by the React Testing Library. All of them including `fresh-testing-library` share an API under the [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) moniker.

The Testing Library philosophy is to create tests that interact with the application the same way an app user would do. To do so, Testing Library tests hone in on verifying DOM elements.

Testing library also focusses on accessibility, offering a number of functions to find elements by accessible attributes.

The `fresh-testing-library` is registered as a Deno third party library under the URL "https://deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library". It's component testing feature is a thin wrapper around the Preact Testing Library.

## Setting up a fresh-testing-library component test

Using `fresh-testing-library` for a component test requires the use of the Deno test runner and the `bdd.ts` submodule of the testing module of the Deno standard library. The `bdd` module adds functions that are familiar to testing in Node.js using libraries like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). They include `describe`, `it`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `beforeEach` and `afterEach`.

Here is a simple example of a `fresh-testing-library` component test:
```ts
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render, setup } from "https://deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library";
import { afterEach, beforeAll, describe, it } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/bdd.ts";
import { assertEquals, assertExists } from "https://deno.land/std/assert/mod.ts";
import Todo from "../islands/Todo.tsx";

describe("Todo.tsx test", () => {
  // setup the jsdom environment
  beforeAll(setup);
  // unmount rendered component after each test
  afterEach(cleanup);

  it("should display todo...", () => {
    // assign the component's text content via a prop
    const text = "Foo";
    // render a component's markup
    const screen = render(<Todo text={text} index={1}/>);
    // find an HTML element using the rendered text content
    const textElement = screen.getByText(text);
    // verify element is found
    assertExists(textElement);
    // verify element's text content
    assertEquals(textElement.textContent, text);
  });
});
```
Run `fresh-testing-library` tests like this using this command line:
```bash
deno test --allow-env
```

## Rendering components

The `render` function of `fresh-testing-library` is inherited from Preact Testing Library. It is used to instantiate the component-under-test. Its first argument is required and is the JSX representation of a component including its props.


```
import { render } from "https:/deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library";
const screen = render(<Counter />);
```


## Finding DOM Elements

As stated previously, Testing Library libraries including `fresh-testing-library` focusses on verifying DOM elements generated by the component-under-test.

Discovering DOM elements to verify their content or existence in a `fresh-testing-library` test requires use of a finder function. Finder function names have three parts:
1. Discover mechanism: 'get', 'query' and 'find'
2. Discover single or multiple nodes: 'By' or 'AllBy'
3. Discover node attributes: 'AltText', 'DisplayValue', 'LabelText', 'PlaceholderText', 'Role', 'TestId' and 'Title'

All finder function names are a composite of the three parts. The `getByText` function is an example.

Put together, the first two parts of a finder function name indicates what the function returns. Here's how that works:

| Finder function | Match Found returns    | Match Not Found returns |
| :-------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------:  |
| getBy*          | matching node          | throws an error         |
| getAllBy*       | matching node          | throws an error         |
| queryBy*        | matching node          | null                    |
| queryAlBy*      | matching node          | empty array             |
| findBy*         | resolved Promise       | rejected Promise        |
| findAllBy*      | resolved Promise       | rejected Promise        |

Also note that if you are using the singular 'getBy', 'queryBy' or 'findBy' functions and more than one element is returned, then an error is thrown. Conversely, a getAllBy, queryAllBy and findAllBy function returns an array with a single element if only one matching element exists.

The full name of a finder function specifies how an element is located. Here's what they are with a 'getBy' prefix (the same functions exist using 'queryBy' or 'findBy'):
- `getByAltText` - finds the element using the `alt` attribute
- `getByDisplayValue` - finds the element using the `value` attribute
- `getByLabelText` - finds the element using the `label` attribute. Obviously, this is mostly used to locate form elements
- `getByPlaceholderText` - finds the element using the `placeholder` attribute found in a `text` or `textarea` element.
- `getByRole` - finds the element by it's `role` attribute.
- `getByTestId` - finds an element using the `data-testid` attribute
- `getByTitle` - finds an element using the enclosed `title`element. This is best used with an svg graphic that contains a `title` child element.

All of the finder functions have the same first two arguments. The first one is an HTML element which would be obtained from a previous call to a finder function. Most of the time you will not need this argument.

The second argument is used to match the the HTML element being searched for. It is either a string or regular expression except 'byRole' that only takes a string.


???Note that most of the finder functions use accessibility-related attributes. This allows you to ensure the markup you create are accessible to screen readers and other non-visual methods.???

## Using byRole finder functions

Kent C. Dodds, the creator of Testing Library, recommends that you should [prefer the use of the 'byRole' finder method to discover DOM nodes for test verification](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library#not-using-byrole-most-of-the-time).

The 'byRole' finder takes a string which is a valid a WAI ARIA role (see this [list of WAI ARIA roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)).

Certain HTML elements have [an implicit role](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance). Some of these elements have the same role name as the element name. They include `button`, `article` and `code`.

Most of the HTML form elements also have implicit roles. This includes `input` elements with `type="text"` (`textbox` role), `type="radio"` (`radio` role), `type="range"` (`slider` role) and `type="number"` (`spinbutton` role).

Roles for HTML elements without an implicit role must be specified using the `role` attribute. Many IDEs like Visual Studio Code support discovery of valid roles using autocompletion. Just type `getByRole("")` with your cursor within the quotes and a list of valid roles will appear. It will look something like this:

![vscode role autocompletion](/img/blog/fresh-testing-library/getByRole_autocomplete.png)


If you use an argument to a 'byRole' finder that is illegal, the error message will point out the available implicit roles. Alternately, you can use the FTL `logRole` function To find the implicit roles within your component-under-test.
