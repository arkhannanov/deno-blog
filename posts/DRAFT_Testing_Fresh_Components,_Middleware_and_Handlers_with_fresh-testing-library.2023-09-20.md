# Testing Fresh Components, Middleware and Handlers with fresh-testing-library

The [`fresh-testing-library`](https://deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library) is a new unit testing utility for Deno Fresh. Until now testing a Fresh application used the built-in Deno test runner with `std/testing` utilities for verifying low-level logic and the [Deno-Puppeteer](https://deno.land/x/puppeteer) or [Astral](https://astral.deno.dev/) libs for end-to-end testing. The `fresh-testing-library` fills the niche between the other options to allow isolated testing of fresh components, middleware and route handlers.

`fresh-testing-library` creates a thin wrapper around the [Preact Testing Library](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/preact-testing-library/) which is built upon the [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro). All of them including `fresh-testing-library` share an API under the [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) moniker.

The `fresh-testing-library` also adds utilities for testing Fresh route handler's, route components and middleware. Those are under the `server.ts` module while the component testing library is under the `component.ts` module. Both can also be accessed via the library's `mod.ts` module.

The Testing Library philosophy is to create tests that interact with the application the same way an app user would do. To do so, Testing Library tests hone in on verifying DOM elements.

Testing library also focusses on accessibility, offering a number of functions to find elements by accessible attributes.

The `fresh-testing-library` is registered as a Deno third party library under the URL "https://deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library". It's component testing feature is a thin wrapper around the Preact Testing Library.

# Component testing
## Setting up a fresh-testing-library component test

Using `fresh-testing-library` for a component test requires the Deno test runner and the `testing/bdd.ts` module of the Deno standard library. The `bdd` module adds functions that are familiar to testing in Node.js using libraries like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). They include `describe`, `it`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `beforeEach` and `afterEach`.

Here is a simple annotated example of a `fresh-testing-library` component test that illustrates test setup and code:
```ts
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render, setup } from "https://deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library";
import { afterEach, beforeAll, describe, it } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/bdd.ts";
import { assertEquals, assertExists } from "https://deno.land/std/assert/mod.ts";
import Todo from "../islands/Todo.tsx";

describe("Todo.tsx test", () => {
  // setup the jsdom environment
  beforeAll(setup);
  // unmount rendered component after each test
  afterEach(cleanup);

  it("should display todo...", () => {
    // assign the component's text content via a prop
    const text = "Foo";
    // render a component's DOM markup
    const screen = render(<Todo text={text} index={1}/>);
    // find an HTML element using the rendered component's text content
    const textElement = screen.getByText(text);
    // verify element is found
    assertExists(textElement);
    // verify element's text content
    assertEquals(textElement.textContent, text);
  });
});
```
Run `fresh-testing-library` tests with this command line:
```bash
deno test --allow-env
```
You might need to add other permission flags depending on the code you are testing.
## Rendering components

The first think you need in a `fresh-testing-library` test is a call to the `render` function, inherited from Preact Testing Library. It is used to instantiate the component-under-test. Its first argument is required and is the JSX representation of a component including its props.

```ts
import { render } from "https:/deno.land/x/fresh_testing_library";
// renders component DOM wrapped inside a document.body
const screen = render(<Counter />);
```
The `render` function has an optional second argument that is rarely used. For more information, see the [`RenderOptions` interface in the `preact-testing-library` type documentation](https://github.com/testing-library/preact-testing-library/blob/main/types/index.d.ts).

## Finding DOM Elements

As stated previously, Testing Library libs including `fresh-testing-library` focusses on verifying DOM elements generated by the component-under-test.

Discovering DOM elements in a `fresh-testing-library` test requires use of a finder function. Finder function names have three parts:
1. The finder mechanism: 'get', 'query' or 'find'
2. Is the search for single or multiple nodes: 'By' or 'AllBy'
3. How to find an element: 'AltText', 'DisplayValue', 'LabelText', 'PlaceholderText', 'Role', 'TestId' or 'Title'

All finder function names are a composite of the three parts. The `getByText` function is an example.

Combined, the first two parts of a finder function name indicates what the function returns. Here's how that works:

| Finder function | Match Found returns    | Match Not Found returns |
| :-------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------:  |
| getBy*          | matching node          | throws an error         |
| getAllBy*       | matching node          | throws an error         |
| queryBy*        | matching node          | null                    |
| queryAllBy*     | matching node          | empty array             |
| findBy*         | resolved Promise       | rejected Promise        |
| findAllBy*      | resolved Promise       | rejected Promise        |

Also note that if you are using the singular 'getBy', 'queryBy' or 'findBy' functions and more than one element is returned, then an error is thrown. Conversely, a getAllBy, queryAllBy and findAllBy function returns an array with a single element if only one matching element exists.

The full name of a finder function specifies how an element is located. Here's what they are with a 'getBy' prefix (the same functions exist using 'queryBy' or 'findBy'):
- `getByAltText` - finds the element using the `alt` attribute
- `getByDisplayValue` - finds an `input`, `textarea` or `select` element using the `value` attribute.
- `getByLabelText` - finds the element using the `label` attribute. Obviously, this is mostly used to locate form elements
- `getByPlaceholderText` - finds the element using the `placeholder` attribute found in a `text` or `textarea` element.
- `getByRole` - finds the element by it's `role` attribute.
- `getByTestId` - finds an element using the `data-testid` attribute
- `getByTitle` - finds an element using the enclosed `title`element. This is best used with an svg graphic that contains a `title` child element.

All of the finder functions have the same first two arguments. The first one is an HTML element which would be obtained from a previous call to a finder function. Most of the time you will not need this argument.

The second argument is used to match the the HTML element being searched for. It is either a string, regular expression or a function that takes a string and element, returning a boolean. The 'ByRole' method only takes specific string values ([see below](#using-byrole-finder-functions)).

Finder functions have an optional third argument which is an options object. The properties of that argument is specific to the finder.

???Note that most of the finder functions use accessibility-related attributes. This allows you to ensure the markup you create are accessible to screen readers and other non-visual methods.???

## Using byRole finder functions

Kent C. Dodds, the creator of Testing Library, recommends that you should [prefer the use of the 'ByRole' finder function to discover DOM nodes](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library#not-using-byrole-most-of-the-time).

A role used by Testing Library comes from the WAI ARIA accessibility standard. This is not well-documented in the library and takes a bit of a learning curve to figure out, so I'm going to delve into it for a bit.

The 'ByRole' finder requires a string that is a valid WAI ARIA role name (see this [list of WAI ARIA roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)).

Certain HTML elements have [an implicit role](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance). Some of these elements have the same role name as the element name. They include `button`, `article`, `code` and `img`.

Nearly all of the HTML form elements also have implicit roles. This includes `input` elements with `type="text"` (`textbox` role), `type="radio"` (`radio` role), `type="range"` (`slider` role), `type="number"` (`spinbutton` role) and `type="submit"` (`button` role). The `textarea` element's implicit role is `textbox` while the `select` element's implicit role is `listbox` or `combobox`.

Do not set and element's `role` attribute when you want to use an implicit role. Sometimes you might have multiple elements with the same role; multiple buttons, for instance. In that case use the options argument.

Each role has a different set of options properties. All of them have a `name` property, but the property's value depends on the role. For the `button` role, the `name` property is the button's value. For the `img` role, the `name` property is the value of the element's `alt` attribute. Roles for HTML elements without an implicit role must be specified using the `role` attribute.

Many IDEs like Visual Studio Code support discovery of valid roles using autocompletion. Just type `getByRole("")` with your cursor within the quotes and a list of valid roles will appear. It will look something like this:

![vscode role autocompletion](/img/blog/fresh-testing-library/getByRole_autocomplete.png)

If you use an argument to a 'ByRole' finder that is illegal, the error message will point out the available implicit roles. Alternately, you can use the `fresh-testing-library` function `logRole` to find the implicit roles within your component-under-test.

## Component testing troubleshooting tips
- Testing `IS_BROWSER` - This constant is used a lot in Fresh app code, but testing it can be problematic. In order to set `IS_BROWSER` to false, you need to set the `document` object to `undefined`. Doing that will cause a `fresh-testing-library` test to fail because the `jsdom` library cannot function with a valid `document` object. Therefore, testing `IS_BROWSER` cannot be done with `fresh-testing library.`
- There are `debug` functions for printing out the DOM returned from calling `render` or any of the finder functions. The former prints out the DOM that was rendered and the latter prints out the returned DOM from a finder function call. Here's how to use them:
```ts
const screen = render(<MyComponent />);
// print out the component's DOM element wrapped in a body element
screen.debug();
const element = screen.queryByRole("button");
// prints out the element's DOM
element.debug();
```
## Fresh Middleware and Route Handler testing with fresh-testing library

### Testing middleware

Testing middleware uses the `createMiddlewareHandlerContext` to mock out the `MiddlewareHandlerContext` used in a middleware handler. Here's what a test would look like for the middleware in this repo;
```ts
// _middleware.ts
import { MiddlewareHandlerContext } from "$fresh/server.ts";

export function handler(
  _req: Request,
  _ctx: MiddlewareHandlerContext,
) {
  return setCacheControlHeaders();
}

export function setCacheControlHeaders() {
  return async (_req: Request, ctx: MiddlewareHandlerContext) => {
    const resp = await ctx.next();
    resp.headers.set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=21600, immutable");
  }
}

// middleware.test.ts
import { assertEquals } from "std/assert/assert_equals.ts";
import { createMiddlewareHandlerContext } from "$fresh-testing-library";
import { setCacheControlHeaders } from "../../routes/_middleware.ts";
import manifest from "../../fresh.gen.ts";

Deno.test("should set Cache-Control header", async () => {
  const middleware = setCacheControlHeaders();
  const req = new Request(`http://localhost:3000/`);
  // Ignore error due to a mis-typed Manifest interface
  // @ts-ignore ignores "type ... is not assignable to type Manifest" error
  const ctx = createMiddlewareHandlerContext(req, { manifest });
  await middleware(req, ctx);
  const resp = await ctx.next();
  assertEquals(resp.headers.get('Cache-control'), "public, max-age=21600, immutable");
});
```
You can use `Deno.test` in this case since a middleware test does not require setup or cleanup.

The `Request` object can be used to find out the current URL or request method (GET, POST, etc) for middleware with logic that is more sophisticated than my simple example.
